This was a submission for BPA group highschool competition for app development. This is an app that you can play alone(searching for landmarks) or with another person(trying to find that person) based on hints and a radius that the object is in.

Warning:
No longer works because of outdated API key and likely outdated code 

Placement:
I entered this alone and placed 6th Nationally
