This was a submission for Business Professionals of America's highschool competition for app development. This is an app that you can play alone(searching for landmarks) or with another person(trying to find that person) based on hints and a radius that the object/person is in. This got me 6th place nationally  as an individual entry in a group event.

Warning:
No longer works because of outdated API key and deprecated code
